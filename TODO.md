# NoSpoilers App - Todo List

## üêõ Bugs to Fix

### 0 . Not Correctly implementing Ranked Choice Voting
- **Problem**: The algorithm to calculate ranked choice is not correct
- **Details**: The number of points a movie gest is based on it's position in a list made by the user. But the position in the list is being used as the actual number of points. This is not correcta s users lists can have varying sizes which mean that movies left off the list get 0 points and movies get points based on the lenght of the list. If there are 3 items the then to pmovie gets 3 points. So adding more movies to your list can effectively boost the number of points a movie receives. THis is not supposed to happen. Go find out how to implement ranked choice voting programatically when not all candidates must be ranked and updat ethe ranking algorihtm.
