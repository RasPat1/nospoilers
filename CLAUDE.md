# Development Guidelines

- Run tests after every change
- Add tests for new features and bugs
- Prefer single test runs over full suite
- Use robust, varied test data
- Stress test all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, videos, links)

## Code Standards
- Build small, reusable modules
- Typecheck after code changes
- Fix console errors immediately or add to todo
- Don't break existing functionality
