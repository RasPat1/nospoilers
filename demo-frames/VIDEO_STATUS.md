## Next Steps

### To Deploy Videos (After Approval)

   ```bash
   open demo-output/comprehensive/nospoilers_complete_demo.mp4
   ```

2. **If approved, deploy to public folder**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/prepare-demo-videos.sh deploy
   ```

3. **Check the homepage**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Scroll to "See It In Action" section
   - Click play button to test video

### To Create Full Demo Videos

1. **Fix the comprehensive demo script**:
   - Update selectors for current UI
   - Add better error handling
   - Complete all 8 scenes

2. **Run the full demo**:
   ```bash
   node demo-frames/comprehensive-demo.js
   ```

3. **Deploy individual scenes**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/prepare-demo-videos.sh deploy
   ```

## Current Issues

1. **Comprehensive demo script needs fixes**:
   - Search result selectors need updating
   - Some API routes still using old imports
   - WebSocket connections causing delays

2. **Individual scene videos not created**:
   - Only main demo exists
   - Scene gallery will show placeholders

3. **Thumbnails not generated**:
