# Fixes Summary

## 1. Database Sharing Issue
The problem is that both local development and production are using the same Supabase database.

### Quick Fix Applied
- Added `environment` field to voting_sessions table to separate dev/prod data
- Updated all API endpoints to filter by environment

### To Apply the Fix
1. Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Add environment field to voting_sessions table
ALTER TABLE voting_sessions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS environment TEXT DEFAULT 'production';

-- Create index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_voting_sessions_environment 
ON voting_sessions(environment, status);

-- Update existing sessions to production
UPDATE voting_sessions 
SET environment = 'production' 
WHERE environment IS NULL;
```

2. Clear your browser's localStorage to get a fresh session ID

### Permanent Solution
Create a separate Supabase project for development (see SEPARATE_DATABASES.md)

## 2. Autocomplete Feature
- Created `MovieSearchForm` component with TMDB search integration
- Shows movie details including year, director, actors, plot
- Fallback to manual entry if movie not found
- Integrated into voting interface

## 3. Clear Vote Feature
- Should now work properly once the environment field is added
- Deletes votes only for the current environment's voting session

## Current Status
- Server is running on http://localhost:3000
- You need to run the SQL migration above
- Clear localStorage and refresh to test
